Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had difficulties on Thursday.
An Argentinian lady shoved Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio, in the opening start of the women's windsurfing.
The offence against Tuuli was a clear one.
The opponent admitted the offence.
She got stuck because of the crash, and others got away, told Joakim Wilenius, Finland’s head coach.
For a long time, the athlete thought about protesting.
But it was no use making it, because it would’ve been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should’ve dropped in the water to get compensation, noted Petäjä-Siren.
The Finn cling to her board to the last, since she didn’t want to fall in to Rio’s dirty water.
Because of the crash, the Finn was 27th in the start.
The silver medallist from the 2012 Olympics is eighth in the total points.
The crash didn’t affect much regarding the top.
Friday is an important day with the starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Deviating from the original information, Petäjä-Siren did’nt make a protest.

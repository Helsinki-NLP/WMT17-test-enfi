Kenya's athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - an odd explanation to a coach’s move
A Kenyan athletics coach, John Anzrah, has been sent home from Rio Olympics after he was found to have been posing as a national team athlete in doping tests.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah was presenting himself as was the 800m star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, who is part of Kenya’s national team management, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
The doping officials reported Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he “committed his crime against team Kenya”.
“He presented himself as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," growled Kip Keino, chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is to run already on that day.
There is no information yet about whether the runner faces some consequences about the incident.
Last year at the world championship Rotich was fourth on this distance, and is one of the favourites to win in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source from inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete’s accreditation card to get free breakfasts in the athlete’s village.
When he met the anti-doping officials, they expected him to be an athlete, and he was taken to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, because he was afraid of being exposed.

Director of Research about changes in Russian leadership: Clearly a move aside
On Friday Russia had its most high-ranking leadership change in years, as President Vladimir Putin removed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is a 44-year old Anton Vaino of Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and has been Ivanov’s deputy.
Kangaspuro says that a reason behind Ivanov’s dismissal can be Putin’s will to prevent strong people around him of gathering too much power.
He adds that rotating leadership tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way to prevent people from increasing their power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or that he has blundered.
A drop in status for Ivanov
Ivanov, who has been part of Putin's inner circle, is now transferring to be the ecology and transport special representative.
On a tape presented by the state media Putin said the change was a mutual decision.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role, and had proposed Vaino as a candidate for his position, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in status.
Ecological or transport matters do not have a very high priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has had a significant role in the president’s Security Council.
During Soviet times, Ivanov worked at KGB together with Putin.
He was considered as Putin’s possible successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became the president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example the governors, has been recently replaced in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that the fact that Putin is replacing his inner circle with younger people is more interesting than who is Ivanov's successor.

Iceland changes its government that was dirtied in the Panama leaks
Iceland will have early parliamentary elections in October, but the protesters angered by Panama revelations demanded them to organised already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
The Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but this was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johansson, promised then to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now set to be October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict the extent of the effect the people’s rage from last spring will have on the autumn’s election result.
In June's presidential elections the criticalness towards those in power was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, who came from outside the politics, was elected president.

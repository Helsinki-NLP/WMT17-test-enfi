Isis fighters used civilians as human shields while retreating in Syria
They used the civilians as human shields as they withdrew to Jarabulus, thus preventing us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurd fighters managed to seize 90 per cent of the Manbij town that was important for Isis.
It is estimated, though, that dozens of jihadists remained in the town then.
Earlier news edited at 7.30 pm: Earlier we mistakenly told that the civilians are fleeing the town, as it really was the Isis fighters who kidnapped the civilians while fleeing the town.

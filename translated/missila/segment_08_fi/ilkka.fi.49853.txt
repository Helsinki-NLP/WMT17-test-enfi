Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful, says professor of public law, Tomi Voutilainen, from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document access cannot be based on an official’s own policies, but it is based on law.
Earlier the Ministry of the Interior refused to surrender the participant list of the Minister of Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified his decision with the instructions by the Prime Minister’s Office and with the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar, not in the accounting material.
The Chief Communications Officer of the Ministry says to STT that the need of reforming the practices has been remarked in the Ministry.

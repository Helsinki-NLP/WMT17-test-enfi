Under-age drunken driver ran away from the police after a chase
A 16-year old motorcyclist from Joensuu tried to escape from a patrol in Ilomantsintie, Joensuu, on Friday night around half past twelve.
The patrol tried to stop the motorcyclist who rode without lights, but the young men tried to escape the police riding with an excessive speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrannantie, where it further proceeded to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this the young man ran away, but the police was quicker and caught the runaway.
The driver’s breathalyser test showed a permillage of 0,75.
He also did not have a driver’s licence that would have permitted to drive on a motorcycle.
The incident is being investigated as aggravated endangering of road safety, among other things.

The wish of the family of the woman murdered in Loviisa: All the possible donations for police dogs
The family of the 42-year old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa wish that instead of flowers and printed forms of condolences, people would make a donation for police dog work.
The Veterinary Clinic of Sipoo posted a Facebook update relaying the victim’s family’s wish about the donations for police dogs.
The post says the victim had worked as a temp at the Veterinary Clinic of Sipoo, and that she had also worked there for her nurse training.
The clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, a good sense of humour, not afraid of work.
A good friend.
We still can’t fully comprehend that she’s gone.
The Facebook post contains an account number where the donations can be transferred.
The status update mentions that all the donated money goes entirely to police dogs, mainly for purchasing body armour vests.
Last Friday a 42-year old woman from Loviisa was murdered on her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbours told Iltalehti she was very fond of animals.
She had several animals, among others a horse, dogs, cats, chicken, and a cock.
The 27-year old man suspected for the murder did not know the woman, and they had no connection to one another.
A police dog Börje was involved in the tracking of the murderer, and the dog was seriously injured during the making of the arrest.
Börje did live, though, and it is getting better.

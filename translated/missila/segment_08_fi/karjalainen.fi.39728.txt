Air pollution makes Londoners older
According to a study, Londoners’ skin ages faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
Evening Standard reports of a British study.
British skincare firm Caci analysed levels of the most toxic tiny particulates in London to investigate their impact on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many senior London citizens will be the equivalent of two-and-a-half years older than that of someone in the countryside. 
This skin-aging fine particles are ultra-fine pollution dust that comes from traffic’s fuel fumes.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, contribute to the deaths of nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
It has been discovered in studies that the particles are small enough to penetrate the skin’s outer layer.
Caci’s study found that premature ageing is a risk especially to those Londoners who commute by walking near busy roads.
Inhabitants of London can attempt to protect from air pollution for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is regular cleansing.

The school is not quite what it used to be
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new teaching curriculum has been created for schools, and it will be implemented in the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
They are the guidelines that govern all Finnish schools.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the curriculum states the official goals.
These guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example cursive handwriting will not be taught anymore, and instead coding will be practised at schools.
Instruction in Swedish will begin on the sixth grade the latest, and social studies will begin already on the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of the pupils.
Before it was thought that a teacher teaches the pupils, but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another.
This is an attempt to make education more interesting.

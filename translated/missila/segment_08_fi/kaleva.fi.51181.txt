Trump says he was being sarcastic when claiming Obama was the founder of Isis
The U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest stir-causing talks.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting president Barack Obama was the founder of terrorist organisation Isis, and that the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had also abetted in the founding of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious about this and demanded an apology from Trump.
Anyone willing to sink so low should never be allowed to serve as our Commander-in-Chief, tweeted Clinton.

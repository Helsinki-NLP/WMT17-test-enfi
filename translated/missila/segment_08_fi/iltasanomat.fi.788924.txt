The bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - horrified tourists escaped
On Thursday evening local time, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were wounded in the attack.
The bombs were probably hidden in a flower pot and then detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreign.
They went off at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars to go back to their hotels, said a police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran according to CNN.
A wildlife protectionist Ewin Wiek, who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a revealing image about the attacks.

At least 11 of those wounded in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People were running towards me saying that a bomb has exploded near the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
In the next morning local time two bombs went off in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of the wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs went off on the island of Phuket that is popular also among Finns.
As far as is known, nobody died.
At the same time there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb went off in the town of Trang.
The police said they had found at least one bomb from Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, those responsible for the bomb attacks are most likely rebel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand’s military leadership.
The local authorities estimate a criminal organisation might also be the culprit.
According to Aftonbladet, the police has lately been snapping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking.

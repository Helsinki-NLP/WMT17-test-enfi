Over 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
An American newspaper Politico reported about the letter, the draft of which it has obtained.
According to the newspaper, the letter is directed to the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signees want the party’s money to be put toward congressional races, instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that Donald Trump’s divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide”, it says in the letter as reported by Politico.
Only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck.
According to the letter, this should not be a difficult decision, as Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week.
Politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman, and Vin Weber are among the signees.
Republican Andrew Weinstein, a vocal anti-Trump Republican, is one of the operatives organizing the letter.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter is coming from “people who want the party to protect its majorities in the Senate and the House”, and that it’s not an endorsement of anybody.
The letter ticks off a series of Donald Trump actions that are believed to have alienated millions of voters.
He is said to also have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week 50 officials working among national security wrote an open letter to state that they won’t support Donald Trump as a president.

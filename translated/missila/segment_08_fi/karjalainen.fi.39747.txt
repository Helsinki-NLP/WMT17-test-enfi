Riento has a new impetus for the coming season
Joensuu-based Liiga-Riento who play in the Finland Volleyball League have the best starting point in ages to the league that begins in October.
The team has been together for nearly three weeks now.
The common language will be certainly found better than during last seasons, when the beginning of the series have been grim to Riento.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Riento’s main coach, praises the new team as energetic and consistent.
From the foreign trio, middle blocker Fred Musoni begins his second season in Riento.
The new faces are 23-year olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who has been in the Rwanda national team, is a 205 cm tall opposite hitter.
Garchet is correspondingly a setter, and the Brazilian is 198 cm tall.

A survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four thinks that organising children’s day care, youth work, and physical education should be a municipality’s responsibilities, reveals a study by KAKS - Kunnallisalan kehittämissäätiö (The Foundation for Municipal Development).
A clear majority of the people shifts the responsibility on to a single municipality also when it comes to libraries, culture, adult education centres, supervision of building, upper secondary school education, and waste management.
As for the province, the clearest hoped-for tasks are regional land use planning, specialised health care, vocational education, polytechnics, and institutional care for mentally disabled.
None of tasks that are municipalities’ responsibilities should be transferred to the state.

Eksote’s result during the first half of the year better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a result that was 3,4 million euros better than planned between January and June.
Eksote’s result showed a surplus of 4,3 million euros during the first half of the year.
The result was especially good in the family and social welfare services, where, by developing preventive services, it has been possible to clear institutional care.
The statutory care guarantee was fulfilled in all operations.
This year Eksote’s goal is to make the operation queues shorter.
Eksote uses the surplus to cover deficit from earlier.
The part left over from that is possibly used to shorten the queues and to buy operations for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4,6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote’s board discusses the half-year review in its meeting next Wednesday.

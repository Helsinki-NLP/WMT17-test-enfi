Salomon Koli bravely began as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks, sweat, and drive.
A young farmer, 25-years old Salomon Koli became a farmer, because he believes in positive future also at the countryside.
Soon two years ago Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, became continuators of his home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers based on his own experience.
Beginning as an agricultural entrepreneur meant contracting debt and making the farm size larger, so that it would be possible to earn one’s bread from farming.
Ever since I was a little boy, this has been my thing.
I've always liked busying myself around the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, it’s all in.
If you begin something, I think you should do it in earnest and properly.
In 2013 we set out to build a cow shed, and in the beginning even the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
I myself was just simply all in with the project, and I've given it my everything, says Salomon Koli adding that he wouldn’t have entered into this project, if he didn’t have faith in producing clean Finnish food, and in that everything will turn out to be fine.
Salomon Koli, who raises beef cattle, has a goal of investing in even bigger a cowshed.
The work has paid off, because Salomon Koli is in the top ten of the young food producer competition organised by newspaper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus.
At the moment he is competing for the possible victory.
You can vote for Salomon on the newspaper’s website until 21. August.

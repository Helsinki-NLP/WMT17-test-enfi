On Friday, the North will be most rainy - temperatures under 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure area on top of northern Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona LÃ¥ng.
There will be rain showers also in the central parts of the country, but the weather will be fair farther south.
The temperatures are not very summery anymore, because the mercury will stay below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The rainy areas in the north will remain in 10-15 degrees.

Posti postal service sent bulk sweets to a wrong town
There were shortages in the bulk sweets selection of Salo’s K-Citymarket, because Posti had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was at Salo’s K-Citymarket on Thursday buying bulk sweets, when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately there are shortages in our bulk sweet selection, because Posti delivered our order to Seinäjoki!
We’ll get more when Posti manages to deliver it!
Unless they’re busy cutting grass, it said in the sign.
The shopkeeper’s jesting sign has to do with Finnish Posti last spring extended their services to cover also grass cutting.
Posti offers grass cutting until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing, and decided to share it on the social media.
I was flabbergasted by the popularity of the post.
The media representatives have been calling me all the time, and the attention attracted by this thing is amazing, Haltia marvelled.
On Friday night Haltia’s post had already over 700 shares at Facebook.
Haltia managed to pick up her favourites to a bag of sweets, even though some of the bins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, Posti’s Vice President of the Freight Services for companies, apologized for the mishap to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background for this is that three of five pallets lost their way and ended up in a wrong place (Seinäjoki), and we didn’t do a partial delivery (to Salo) at three o’clock, but delivered the five pallets only today, Kaidesoja said to Ilta-Sanomat.
The first to report about this was Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not irritated about the sign, because she was able to find all hear bulk sweet favourites from the selection.

I just try to have a little bit of fun, laughs BBC’s Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton in Iltalehti’s quick interview.
Monday’s story about Helen Skelton (on the right) is one of the most read ones on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t really stress, if there’s some fuss in the social media or British press about her revealing and unique outfits.
Television is a visual media, she emphasises.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a shortish dress that certainly is adequately revealing - at least for many conservative British viewers’ eyes.
There will be no steps backwards, though.
It is important to look good, and small sensations are only a fun thing.
Surely Skelton want to cut a dash and possible startle, too, but she stresses that she doesn’t want to be in the main role.
This is not about me, she states.
We’re here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn’t matter so much how I dress myself.
Can you imagine that the sensation has reached Finland, too?
No, I cannot, but anything that draws the focus on how hard these swimmers are working and on the big sacrifices they’re doing is fine by me, grins Skelton.
You know what?
It’s much ado about nothing, if the (commentator's) dressing causes it.
I’m a little amused, if this has hit someone’s radar.

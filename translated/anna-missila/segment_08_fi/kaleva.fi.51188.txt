Swim water quality in Oulu region passed the screening - blue-green algae opacity at Pyykösjärvi
The water samples collected from the official beaches in Oulu region meet the quality demands set for swim water.
Pyykösjärvi beach is the only one with observed blue-green algae.
The Environmental Office of Oulu Region took water samples during Tuesday and Wednesday from the nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, all the other beaches’ E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels in swim waters were below the action limits set in the decrees by Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacteria levels had declined and were under the action limits.
Blue-green algae opacity found from Pyykösjärvi beach does not in itself make the water unsuitable for swimming, but if the conditions are favourable, the situation can develop to algal blooms quite fast, and then there will be blue-green algae mass sheets formed on the water surface.
The Environmental Office will follow up the situation with more frequent checks.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into algal blooms, the issue will be reported separately also on the beach notice board.

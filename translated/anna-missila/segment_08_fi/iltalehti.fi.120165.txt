BBC: Man United’s big signing suspended - he won’t be in the first match of the Premier League
Football signings’ world-record man won’t be seen on the field, when the English Premier League will begin this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed him to England.
Manchester United's big signing Paul Pogba is suspended for his Man United’s first Premier League match of the season against Bournemouth, BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, Man United paid 105 million euros for Pogba to Italian team Juventus.
The English Football Association FA is keeping him from the game, because Pogba got a suspension in Juventus.
He got two yellow cards in last season’s Coppa Italia, and that results in a one game ban.
This ban has carried over to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next possibility to play is on the second round of the League on August 19, when Man United plays against Southampton.

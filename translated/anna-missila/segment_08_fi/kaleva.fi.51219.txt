Finnish study can help in improving the effect of cancer treatments
The new study results from researchers in University of Turku can help in developing more effective cancer treatments.
The observations by Academy of Finland Researcher Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of a cancer tumour increases the cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, like breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow as usual in an environment such as this.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to stop the cancer growth in a laboratory environment by returning the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future it may be possible to improve medical cancer treatments’ effectiveness by focussing on the communication between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatments.
The study results have been published 4 August in a prestigious cellular biology publication, Nature Communications.

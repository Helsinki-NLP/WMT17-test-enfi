Ingredients for a disaster - see the picture gallery of the Parafest destruction
A downburst knocked over Parafest festival’s tents and caused massive destruction.
The president of Joensuu’s Parafestyhdistys, Arto Pippuri, estimated that the festival will recover financially, and the event can be arranged also next year.
The last Parafest artist, Kalle Salonen, performed in the end of Friday evening on the market stage.
On Saturday the programme will continue at 1 pm with performances in the town theatre’s facilities.
A Parafest exhibition is held at art centre Ahjo between 1 and 3 pm.
The programme will be arranged as planned.
A downburst emanates in a thunder cloud, when rain water and its weight start a downward air flow.
The changes of state of the thunder cloud’s water bind warmth, and this is how the descending air mass gets cooler and its velocity accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute says that there are several downbursts in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict a downburst’s route.
A downburst hit Joensuu’s art museum’s backyard that was the scene for Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were knocked down, with a total of about 200 people inside them.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among these people was one child, who was taken to further examinations slightly hurt.

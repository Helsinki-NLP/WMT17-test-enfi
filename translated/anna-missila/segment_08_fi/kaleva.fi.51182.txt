The mayor of Cannes in south of France has banned the use of demure burkini swimsuit favoured by the Muslims on the beaches, reports among others a British newspaper guardian.
Mayor David Lisnard signed off on the ruling stating access to beaches and for swimming is banned to anyone who does not have bathing apparel which respects good customs and secularism.
The ruling also states that beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation is liable to create risks of disrupting public order in France, which has been a target for terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people were killed and hundreds hurt in Nice, when a 31-year old man drove to a crowd celebrating French national holiday.
In the end of July two men, who had been connected to extremist organisation Isis, attacked a church in northern France killing a priest who was over 80 years old.

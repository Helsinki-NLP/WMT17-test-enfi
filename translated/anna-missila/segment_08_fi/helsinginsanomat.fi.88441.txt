The longest lived vertebrate in the world was found - the Greenland shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the grey shark, does not reach its sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live 250 years after that, a new study reported.
These numbers make this species to be the longest lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom there is only one who passes it: the oldest ocean quahog known has been estimated to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim around the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are also the biggest fish in the arctic area.
The females are taller than the males, as they can grow to be over five metres tall.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre a year according to monitoring, the adult specimens must have lived a long life.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of 28 adult female Greenland sharks that had been trapped in fishermen's nets.
The age of the fish was revealed in radiocarbon dating their eye lenses.
The average age of the studied sharks was revealed to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the amazon-sized fish of 493 and 502 centimetres long, were revealed to 335 and 392 years old respectively.
Since the other studies have found out that the Greenland shark females do not reach maturity until they are over 4 metres long, the researchers calculated they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.

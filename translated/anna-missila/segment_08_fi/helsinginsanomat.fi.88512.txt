Those under 15 to account for their crimes? 
Helsinki will experiment peer juries familiar from the United States
A so-called peer jury will experiment will begin in Helsinki to prevent young people to getting into a vicious circle of crime.
At first the experiment will be applied to those under 15, who now are left without criminal responsibility.
A jury of peers will weigh in on the first crime a young person commits.
The idea is that the jury of peers will discuss what happened with the offender and prescribe a sanction.
A week later the offender can join the jury of peers themselves to make up for what they did.
Other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family explaining, what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Youth work director Tommi Laitio says it is not a strict model.
We also have other conciliation models that are used side by side.
“They all direct a young person’s actions towards a more responsible direction, so that everything would not be ruined after the first mistake”, says Laitio.
The model for the jury of peers comes from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person doesn’t have to stand in front of an adult panel, but can reflect what has happened together with other people of approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
Ilkka Lovio, service designer from service design office Palmu who has followed the experiment says that it was an assault that was successfully cleared up.
Before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all.
“It has been a message to carry on on the path you have chosen”, Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of a project focusing on immigrants in Helsinki (Maahanmuuttajien Helsinki), on the background of which are the City of Helsinki and the We Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that these new practises are offered to all who need them, not just for young immigrants.

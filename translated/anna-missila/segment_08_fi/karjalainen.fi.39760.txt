From Josba, Kataja, and Jokipojat to team USA
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every floorball world championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere it's already the sixth contest going on, with the only miss from 2013 when Canada was better in North America’s qualifications.
I was working in Turku and played for a local women's club when I saw the ad.
USA is creating a national team for floorball.
I got interested, and here we are now, says 48-year old Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in the town of Elizabeth near new York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen got in to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no national level in floorball yet.
Floorball was played as a hobby in the university.
I used to play basketball in Kataja, and then later Finnish national league ice hockey in Jokipojat, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball in the Finnish national league in 1991-92 in the university’s club, and the following next year was spent in Josba.
While playing, she also coached the clubs A girls to a championship.
Her career in the women’s national league culminated in silver in 1995.
Altogether Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish national league for women, earning a point total of 51+34=85 in 169 matches.
Her final national league level season was 2001-2002.

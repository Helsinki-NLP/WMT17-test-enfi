A Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: “The attack has no effect on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in the same premises in Phuket, is not worried about the effect the Thailand’s bomb attacks have on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I believe nothing much will follow from this, estimates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia about two decades.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand close up.
There is always something here.
First a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these earlier ones didn’t chase the tourists away, I doubt this will, either.
Huovila’s company offices are located a few hundred metres from the bomb attack scene.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called him about nine o’clock local time and said he should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning.
They thought the road blocks were set up because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm, and the businesses on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 local time.
At the beach, many of the people hadn’t even heard about the attacks.
Around 2.30 in the afternoon Thailand’s time, the traffic at Patong had returned to normal, and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack place, the explosion was relatively small, says Huovila, who went to see the attack place.

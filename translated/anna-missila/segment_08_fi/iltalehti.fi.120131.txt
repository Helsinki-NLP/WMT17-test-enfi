A District Court sentenced Posti for committing a breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to keep the wages of an employee who declined to give workplace initiation to an agency contract worker, estimated the District Court of Tavastia Proper in its sentence.
The District Court enjoined Posti to pay the employee most of the retained wages and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have retained just that part of the initiator’s wages that was equal to the initiation part of the whole day’s work.
The District Court said the employee had been, against the Anti-Discrimination Act, placed in an unfavourable position based on their trade unionism.
The employee had followed the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU’s union decision about workplace initiation ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti’s employees will not initiate agency contract workers that break the strike.
The first to report the matter was Kansan Uutiset.

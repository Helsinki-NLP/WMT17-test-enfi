KSML: This part of the new readiness units are the first to go into battle in war situations
In an acute war situation, the conscripts wonâ€™t be sent to battle until several months after they have sworn their oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
The newspaper interviewed the Chief of Education of the Finnish Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who said that for example from those conscripts that serve 5,5 months only those are effective who are finishing their training.
According to the Chief of Education, the first ones to be called up are those reservists who are part of the readiness units.
No conscripts or reservists are called up to a duty they do not have the required training for, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it was found out that the Finnish Defence forces begin to train conscripts to readiness units from the beginning of the next year.
The units can be used in military operations already during the conscript training, if necessary.

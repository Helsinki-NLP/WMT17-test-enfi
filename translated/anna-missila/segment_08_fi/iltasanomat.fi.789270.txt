Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after a huge performance
Weight lifter Milko Tokola was successful after a hard battle with his final try of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a unique and highly dangerous characteristic for a lifter.
During heavy lifts or right after them he has lost consciousness many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola’s result in jerk was 175 kilos and in snatch 145 kilos.
His total result was 320 kilos.
Tokola attempted to have a jerk result of 175 kilos with his last try, and also with his second attempt.
During his third attempt, he lifted the weights with furious roar.
His body was shaking under the weight, until the judges approved of the jerk.
The fact that he had been suffering of knee problems accompanied the Finnish lifter’s joy.

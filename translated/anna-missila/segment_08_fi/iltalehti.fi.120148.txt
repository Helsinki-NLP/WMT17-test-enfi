Putin removed his Chief of Staff - replacement is Vaino of Estonian background
Kremlin says Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, has dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
His successor is the grandson of Soviet-Estonia’s communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year old ex-diplomat, who has been the Deputy Chief of Staff since 2012.
Vaino will also become a member of Russia’s security council, says news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his Chief of Staff.
Ivanov, who has been part of Putin's close inner circle, is now transferring to be the ecology and transport special representative according to Kremlin’s press release.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role, and had proposed Vaino as a candidate for his position, reports Russia Today.
During Soviet times, Ivanov worked in KGB’s espionage together with Putin.
Many considered him as Putin’s possible successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became the president.
Ivanov was appointed to his duty in 2011 before Putin was re-elected as President in 2012.

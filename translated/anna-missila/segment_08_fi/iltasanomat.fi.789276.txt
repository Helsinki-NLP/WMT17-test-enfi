RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who play in men’s premier football division in Finland, has made contract until the end of the season with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa.
We were looking for a striker with good capacities, who would settle in easily to Finland and to Rovaniemi.
Together with 10 player agents we went through over 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, said RoPS coach Juha Malinen in a press release.
Prosa, 25, come to RoPS from a Tallinn team Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to play with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi group meets the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new forward, when their last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.

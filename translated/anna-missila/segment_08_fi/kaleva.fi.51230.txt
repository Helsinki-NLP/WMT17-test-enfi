Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate in the world, does not reproduce until its 156 years old
The longest-living vertebrate in the world was confirmed to be the Greenland shark, stated a study published by Science.
Greenland shark, also known as grey shark, swims in the North Atlantic, like around Greenland, and can live to be up to 400 years old.
The female does not reproduce until its 156 years old.
Greenland shark’s life span is lengthened by the fact it grows only about 1 centimetre a year.
Only a certain clam species is known to live longer than the Greenland shark.
The researchers revealed the age with radiocarbon dating.
Some of the sharks had radioactive traces because of the nuclear tests done in the 1950s.
Based on those, the researchers were able to estimate the sharks’ age.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years, however the variation can be as much as plus or minus 120 years.

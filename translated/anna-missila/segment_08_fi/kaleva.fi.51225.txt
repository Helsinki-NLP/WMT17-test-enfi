Both were compos mentis at the time of the crime

According to the Court’s rationale for the sentence, the 17-year old who was sentenced for murder attacked the supervisor from behind, as this was sitting on the living room sofa.
The supervisor managed to disentangle himself from the hold, leading the young person to his room, when the other of young person hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The supervisor was also strangled with a cord, hit, and kicked to the head.
According to the mental examination, both of the condemned were of sound mind in the time of the crime.

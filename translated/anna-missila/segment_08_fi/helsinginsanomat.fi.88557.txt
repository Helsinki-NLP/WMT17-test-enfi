How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, it's depth being 95,3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technique diving instructor Matti Kannela found a hollow sized approximately 20 square metres from Ristiselkä, and the diving computer showed its bottom depth to be 104 metres.
In summer 2014, Finnish Environment Institute attempted to confirm the finding using echo-sounding, but it was in vain.
The method does not necessarily find a small hollow from a hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi, and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as much as Päijänne.
Especially Inarijärvi’s bottom has not been carefully mapped.
“There might well be some unknown depths”, Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it would be Suuri Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
This way examined, Päijänne is not among the top ten of the deepest , and Suvasvesi is even farther from the top.
